Introduction

ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available as Open Source.
It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, cameras and film
recorders, and calibration and profiling of displays and RGB & CMYK printers.
Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of illuminants observer
types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation. Profiles can also
incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual and saturation intents.
Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique
gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of rendering intents. Device Link
can be created with a wide variety of advanced options. It also includes code for
the fastest portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as
well as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts
can also be viewed and compared using a VRML viewer. Comprehensive documentation
is provided for each major tool, and a general guide to using the tools for typical
color management tasks is also available. A mailing list provides support for
more advanced usage.

This is Version 1.1.1, a bug fix release following the V1.1.0 release on
