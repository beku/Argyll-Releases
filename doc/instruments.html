<h3><a name="strip"></a>Strip reading instruments</h3>
When used with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DT20</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DTP41</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">DTP51</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro<span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span></span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki</span>
strip reading
instrument,
chartread
will first establish communications with the instrument, and then set
it
up ready to read the strips. The strips are labeled A to ZZ, and for
each
strip it will prompt:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About to read strip XX&nbsp; :<br>
<br>
where XX is the strip label, and this is followed by the available
options to navigate, read the strip, or finish.<br>
<br>
For the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTP51</span> you should feed
the strip
into the instrument, and the microswitch will trigger the read.<br>
For the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">DTP41</span> you should line the
appropriate strip up
in
the machine, and press its button.<br>
For the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro</span> you should
set
the guide to the appropriate strip, place the instrument ahead of
the first patch, and then press and hold the instruments button. When
you hear a beep from the computer, you can then move the instrument
steadily over the patches, releasing the button after the instrument is
past the last patch. Moving the instrument too fast or changing speeds
may cause a mis-read, or a scan with few samples read per patch.<br>
For the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki</span> with the
default chart, the patches are the same width as the silver portion of
body (white version), or the textured portion of the body (black
version). Place aperture of the the instrument (located at its center)
in the white space ahead of
the first patch, and then press and hold the instruments button. When
you hear a beep from the computer, you can then move the instrument
steadily over the patches, releasing the button after the instrument is
past the last patch. Moving the instrument too fast or changing speeds
may cause a mis-read, or a scan with few samples read per patch. For
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">high density</span> ColorMunki
chart (<a href="printtarg.html#h">printtarg -h</a>), the patches are
arranged so that three rows are exactly the width of the&nbsp; body of
the instrument. If you are careful you can use this to guide the center
of the instrument over each row, or you may prefer to use something
like a plastic ruler to help guide the instrument.<br>
Using
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTP20</span> or the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki</span> with a randomized chart
layout, the strip may be scanned
from either direction. If a randomized chart layout has not been used
for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki</span>, then the chart should
only be read in the one direction (use <a href="chartread.html#B">chartread
-B</a>).<br>
<br>
Note
that you may have to check that system alert sounds are enabled and at
a suitable volume to in order to hear the beep prompt. For the Eye-One
Pro and ColorMunki, a second beep will sound after a successfully read
strip, or a
double beep will sound,&nbsp; indicating a failure or warning that
needs attention. See also the note on Linux in <a
 href="Installing_Linux.html">installation</a>.<br>
<br>
If the strip is read successfully, the line will be followed with:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read strip&nbsp; XX&nbsp; : <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strip
read
OK<br>
<br>
If there is an error of some sort, a message will be issued, and you
will
be asked whether to abort the chart reading, or retry the<br>
failed strip:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read strip XX&nbsp; : <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strip read failed due to misread (Not enough patches)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Esc to give up, any other key to retry:<br>
<br>
If you are unable to successfully read a strip after several retries,
you can skip that strip using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'n'</span>
key, and save<br>
the chart readings without that strip.<br>
<br>
If the strip is read successfully, but the patches values don't seem to
be what is expected, you will get the following type of warning:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read strip&nbsp; XX&nbsp; :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Warning) Seem to have read strip&nbsp; YY&nbsp;
rather
than&nbsp;
XX !<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Return to use it anyway, any other key to retry,
Esc, ^C or Q to give up:<br>
<br>
This could be because you have accidentally read the wrong strip (a
common mistake), or it could be that the device response is so
different from what is expected that warning is erroneous, or you may
get a lot of these sorts of warnings if you are accidentally reading
the wrong chart. <br>
If you are absolutely sure you lined up the correct strip, then hit
return,
otherwise
line the appropriate strip up again, and hit some other key (ie. space).<br>
Erroneous warnings are less likely if a previous profile for a device
was given to <span style="font-weight: bold;">targen</span> to set
more accurate expectations.<br>
<br>
You may also see the following type of warning:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read strip&nbsp; XX&nbsp; :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Warning) Patch error YY.YYY (&gt;35 not good,
&gt;95 bad)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is at least one patch with an very unexpected
response!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Return to use it anyway, any other key to retry,
Esc, ^C or Q to give up:<br>
<br>
Similar to the previous warning, this indicates that while the right
strip appears to have been read, one of the patch readings is quite
different to what is expected. This may indicate an error of some sort
(ie. damaged test chart, or bad instrument positioning), or may be
erroneous if the actual device response is quite different to the
expectation. Erroneous warnings are less likely if a previous profile
for a device
was given to <span style="font-weight: bold;">targen</span> to set
more accurate expectations.<br>
<br>
You can also navigate the next strip to be read using the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'f'</span> key to move forward and the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'b'</span> keys<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
to move backwards. The prompt will indicate whether this strip has
already been read or not, or whether all strips have been read. You can
also use <span style="font-weight: bold;">'n'</span> to move forward
to the next unread strip. After each successful reading it will move
forward to the next unread strip. When you are finished, use the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'d'</span> to indicate that you are done.
You can choose to finish before all the strips are read, and the
patches that have been read will be saved to the .ti3 file. This is
useful if you are unable to read a particular strip successfully, or if
you are unable to finish the chart in one session, and you can later <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">resume</span> reading the chart by
using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread -r</span> flag.
[You could resume reading the chart patch by patch using the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">chartread -r -p</span> if you are unable to
read a strip successfully.]<br>
<br>
You can abort the whole process at any time by hitting Escape, and the
readings will not be saved.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="xy"></a>X-Y Table instruments</h3>
When you are using an XY table type instrument, such as a Gretag
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SpectroScan</span>,
&nbsp;chartread will first establish communications with the
instrument,
and then set it up ready to read the chart. You will be prompted for
each
sheet with a message such as:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please make sure that the white reference is in slot
1, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place sheet 1 of 4 on table, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit return to continue, Esc to give up<br>
<br>
After hitting return you will be prompted to line up three squares on
the
sheet, one at a time:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the XY table controls, locate patch A1 with
the
sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then hit return to continue, Esc to give up<br>
<br>
On completing this, the instrument will commence reading each sheet.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3><a name="spot"></a>Spot reading instruments</h3>
When used with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">DT22</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">SpectroLino</span> or use the patch by
patch reading mode (<span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread -p</span>)
with the <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro<span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span></span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki</span>
instrument,
or use the external values mode (<span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread
-x</span>), chartread
will first establish communications with the instrument, and then set
it
up ready to read the patches. The patches are typically labeled by
column A to ZZ, and row 1-999. Each
patch will prompt:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read patch 'XX'&nbsp; :<br>
<br>
where XX is the patch label, and this is followed by the available
options to navigate, read the strip, or finish.<br>
<br>
Place the instrument on the indicated patch, and trigger a reading
using one of the available methods (typically using the instrument
switch of pressing a key).<br>
<br>
There should be an audible prompt on a successful or failed reading. <br>
<br>
Note
that you may have to check that system alert sounds are enabled and at
a suitable volume to in order to hear the beep prompt. For the Eye-One
Pro and ColorMunki, a second beep will sound after a successfully read
strip, or a
double beep will sound,&nbsp; indicating a failure or warning that
needs attention. See also the note on Linux in <a
 href="Installing_Linux.html">installation</a>.<br>
<br>
If the patch is read successfully, the line will be completed with:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read patch&nbsp; XX&nbsp; :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patch
read
OK<br>
<br>
If there is an error of some sort, a message will be issued, and you
will
be asked whether to abort the chart reading, or retry the<br>
failed patch:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready to read patch XX&nbsp; : read_strip returned
'Strip
misread' (Bad reading)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strip read failed due to misread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit Esc to give up, any other key to retry:<br>
<br>
You can navigate the next patch to be read using the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'f'</span> key to move forward and the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'b'</span> keys<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
to move backwards, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">'F'</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">'B'</span> will move forward and
backwards by 10 patches. The prompt will indicate whether this patch
has
already been read or not, or whether all patches have been read. You
can
also use <span style="font-weight: bold;">'n'</span> to move forward
to the next unread patch. When
you are finished, use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'d'</span>
to indicate that you are done. You can choose to finish before all the
patches are read, and they will be saved to

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="ColorMunki"></a>ColorMunki
reflective/emissive spectrometer<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 272px; height: 243px;" alt=""
 title="ColorMunki (White)" src="ColorMunki.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Availability:<br>
<br>
</span>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ColorMunki</span> from <a
 href="http://www.xrite.com/">X-Rite</a>&nbsp; is
currently available in two different packages from the manufacturer.
These packages differ in what features the manufacturers software
provides, as well as cosmetic differences between the instrument (white
and black). This comparison <a
 href="http://www.colormunki.com/product/show?page=2">chart</a>
illustrates the differences. Used with Argyll, there are no differences
in operation of a ColorMunki instrument, irrespective of which package
it came with. The ColorMunki Design has the lowest RRP, but the Photo
package may be cheaper with discounting .<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Limitations:</span><br>
<br>
Unlike the Eye-One Pro, the ColorMunki is only available in a U.V. Cut
(Ultra Violet filtered) model. This means that it is not suitable for
use with the&nbsp; Fluorescent Whitener Additive Compensation option in
Argyll (see <a href="FWA.html">here</a> for a discussion about what
FWA compensation is).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Patch recognition:</span><br>
<br>
For the best chances of good patch recognition, the instrument should
be drawn smoothly and not too rapidly over the strip. If there is a
misread, try slowing down slightly.
Generally a higher quality set of readings will result if slower scans
are used, since there will then be more samples averaged for each patch.<br>
<br>
In <a href="chartread.html">chartread</a>, the -<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">T ratio</span>
argument modifies the patch consistency tolerance threshold for the
ColorMunki. In recognizing patches
in a strip, the instrument takes multiple readings as the strip is
read, and then divide the readings up into each patch. It then
check the consistency of the multiple readings corresponding to each
patch, and reject the measurement if they are too inconsistent. For
some media (ie. a coarser screens, fabric etc.) the default tolerance
may be unreasonably tight, so the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-T
ratio</span> argument can be used to modify this criteria. To loosen
the tolerance, use a number greater than 1.0 (ie. 1.5, 2.0). <br>
<br>
Note that <a href="printtarg.html">printtarg</a> provides the <a
 href="printtarg.html#h">-h</a> option that allows the choice of two
different patch row widths with ColorMunki test charts.<br>

<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Availability:<br>
<br>
</span>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTP20</span> from <a
 href="http://www.xrite.com/">X-Rite</a> was discontinued during 2007,
but may still be available from old stock or second hand. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Special features:</span><br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">DTP20</span> has a couple of
unique features that Argyll can take advantage of. One is that it can
operate un-tethered (off line). A whole chart can be read un-tethered
by first
clearing any previous readings in the instrument, then reading the
chart TID strip, before reading all the other strips. The instrument
can then be connected up to <span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread</span>,
which will recognize the chart, and download all the measurements.<br>
If there is no chart in the instrument when chartread connects to it,
then it will use the strip by strip tethered mode, just like the other
strip instruments. If the right number of spot readings are present in
the instrument, these will be used by <span style="font-weight: bold;">chartread</span>
too.<br>
<br>
Un-tethered spot measurements can also be read in using&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span>,
which will notice the stored readings, and offer to print them out, or
they can be ignored, and tethered readings taken. This will
clear any saved spot readings.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> that tethered (on-line)
strip reading
will only work if the firmware in the device is version 1.03 or
greater. You can check the firmware version by running with the verbose
option: <span style="font-weight: bold;">-v<br>

</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Availability:<br>
<br>
</span>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eye-One Pro</span> from <a
 href="http://www.xrite.com/">X-Rite</a> (was Gretag MacBeth) is
available in two packages from the manufacturer.
These packages differ partly in what accessories come with the
instrument, but primarily in what features the manufacturers software
provides. This comparison <a
 href="http://www.xrite.com/documents/literature/en/L11-254_Product_Line_Comparison_en.pdf">chart</a>
illustrates the differences. Used with Argyll, there are no differences
in operation of an
Eye-One Pro instrument, irrespective of which package it came with. The
lowest cost package is the <a
 href="http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?id=861">i1Basic</a>,
and it is also included in the <a
 href="http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=792">i1XTreme</a>
package.<br>
<br>
The EFI ES-1000 (which is a re-badged Eye-One Pro) is also reported to
work with Argyll.<br>
<br>
Unless you know what you're doing, and have a very specific reason to
buy an instrument fitted with a UV (Ultra Violet) filter, make sure
that you buy an instrument without the filter. A UV filtered instrument
can't deal intelligently with FWA (Fluorescent Whitener Additive)
effects in paper. (Look <a href="FWA.html">here</a> for more
information about FWA compensation.) You can emulate a UV cut
instrument quite well in
Argyll by using FWA compensation mode, and supplying a UV filtered D50
illuminant spectrum (ie. ref/D50_0.0.sp).<br>
<br>
There have been three revisions of the Eye-One Pro, Rev. A, B and D.
The rev D is capable of sampling twice as fast as the Rev. A and B
versions of the instrument, and is also available with an ambient light
reading capability.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span> for those running on Linux
with a Rev. D, there is a problem with the current (as of Feb 2008)
Linux USB
stack that causes the instrument to stop working once it has been used.
The only workaround is to unplug and replug the instrument in again,
whereupon it can be used one time again. A fix for this problem will
probably turn up in the&nbsp; Linux 2.6.26 kernel release.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Patch recognition:</span><br>
<br>
For the best chances of good patch recognition, the instrument should
be drawn smoothly and not too rapidly over the strip. If there is a
misread, try slowing down slightly. The Rev A and B. instruments have a
slower
sampling rate than the latter
revision instruments, and hence must be used a bit more slowly.
Generally a higher quality set of readings will result if slower scans
are used, since there will then be more samples averaged for each patch.<br>
<br>
In <a href="chartread.html">chartread</a>, the -<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">T ratio</span>
argument modifies the patch consistency tolerance threshold for the
Eye-One Pro. In recognizing patches
in a strip, the instrument takes multiple readings as the strip is
read, and then divide the readings up into each patch. It then
check the consistency of the multiple readings corresponding to each
patch, and reject the measurement if they are too inconsistent. For
some media (ie. a coarser screens, fabric etc.) the default tolerance
may be unreasonably tight, so the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-T
ratio</span> argument can be used to modify this criteria. To loosen
the tolerance, use a number greater than 1.0 (ie. 1.5, 2.0). <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Differences between reading modes:<br>
<br>
</span>The spotread -d mode uses a fixed integration time, choosing 1
of 3 depending on the display brightness. The advantage of this is that
the readings are all consistent (there can be no mismatch of
sensitivity due to integration and/or gain changes), and the dark level
is calibrated at the exact integration time used.<br>
<br>
The spotread -e or -a modes are adaptive, so the range of brightness is
much greater, but the measurement time will be variable, and the dark
level<br>
is interpolated. The adapative mode can be used with dispcal and
dispread by using the -V flag, and this may give better results for
displays capable of very deep blacks.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Special features:</span><br>
<br>
A feature unique to Argyll when used with the Eye-One
Pro, is the high resolution spectral mode. This returns spectral
measurements at 3.333 nm spacing, rather than the default 10nm spacing,
and also extends the range of wavelengths slightly. This high
resolution may assist in giving better accuracy for "peaky" emissive
sources such as illuminants and displays. The high resolution mode is
selected by using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-H</span> flag
on the command line to <span style="font-weight: bold;">dispcal</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">dispread</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">chartread</span>, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span>. It can also be toggled on
and off within <span style="font-weight: bold;">spotread</span> using
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">h</span> key. The extended range
down to 350nm may give some information about an illuminants ultra
violet content, although the accuracy of the readings between 350-380,
and 730-750nm should not be relied upon.<br>

support:<br>
<br>
This instrument cannot function without the driver
software having access to the vendor supplied PLD firmware pattern for
it.<br>
This firmware is not provided with Argyll, since it
is not available under a compatible license.<br>
<br>
The purchaser of a Spyder 2 instrument
should have received a copy of this firmware along with their
instrument, and
should therefore be able to enable the Argyll driver for this
instrument by
using the <a href="spyd2en.html">spyd2en</a> utility.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">USB hub problems:<br>
<br>
</span>Note that the Spyder doesn't appear to operate at all well if
attached to a USB hub. If Argyll has difficulty in reliably talking to
the Spyder, try connecting it directly to the computer, rather than via
a usb hub. (This seems to be a bug in the Spyder USB implementation.)<br>

The accuracy of this instrument does not seem to be comparable to the

of measuring dark colors, and I've seen the best results when used with
a CRT display. It may well give good results in calibrating projectors,
since this was what it was designed to do<br>
